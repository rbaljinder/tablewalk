/**
 * The database browser's own looks: two directions to choose from, worn over the native tokens.
 *
 * Not the App framework's looks. The Workbench wears its own tokens and no App look (docs/design.md, "Two dresses");
 * these are the kit's host looks (visualTheme.ts `registerHostLooks`): they appear in Preferences beside the kit's,
 * persist under the Workbench's look key, and set `data-host-look` on the root, which each stylesheet is keyed on. A
 * look's sheet is fetched only when it is worn, and waited for before the shell boots, so the first paint carries none.
 * `?look=blueprint` (or `console`, or `default`) picks one from the address, as a link to a look.
